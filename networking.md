There is no single command that can generate a fully formed `/etc/network/interfaces` file with all of the options and settings you specified. However, there are commands that you can use to gather information about your network interfaces, which you can then use to manually create your interfaces file.

1. To list all your network interfaces, you can use the command:

   ```
   ip addr show
   ```

   or the older command:

   ```
   ifconfig -a
   ```

   Both commands will show you the names of your network interfaces, along with other information like their IP addresses and MAC addresses.

2. To find the default gateway, you can use the command:

   ```
   ip route | grep default
   ```

   This will show you the default gateway along with the interface it's associated with.

3. If you want to view the current iptables rules, you can use the command:

   ```
   sudo iptables -L -v -n
   ```

   Note that you'll need root permissions to run this command.

4. If you're looking for a specific configuration like the one you provided (which includes a bridge interface and specific `iptables` rules), these configurations are usually manually set up to meet specific network requirements. Therefore, if these configurations do exist on your system, you would probably already know about them because you (or someone else) would have set them up.

Remember, you need to assemble this information manually into a `/etc/network/interfaces` file following the syntax rules for that file. Be sure to back up your existing file before making changes, and be prepared to fix it via console or physical access in case your changes prevent the system from connecting to the network.

You can find more information about the syntax and options for the `/etc/network/interfaces` file in its man page, which you can access by typing `man 5 interfaces` in your terminal.
