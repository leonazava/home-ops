To create a bootable USB drive with the Proxmox ISO using a Mac, you will need to use a tool like `dd` or a third-party software such as balenaEtcher. The `dd` command is a powerful tool that can copy and convert files, but it must be used with caution as it can overwrite any partition of your machine.

Please follow these steps:

1. **Download the ISO file**: Make sure you have the Proxmox ISO file downloaded to your Mac.

2. **Insert the USB Drive**: Plug your USB drive into your Mac.

3. **Identify the USB Drive**: Open Terminal and type `diskutil list`. This will list all the disks currently connected to your Mac. Identify the disk that corresponds to your USB drive. It will probably look something like `/dev/disk2` or `/dev/disk3`.

4. **Unmount the USB Drive**: Once you've identified the USB drive, you need to unmount it before you can write to it. Type `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN` where N corresponds to your disk. 

5. **Create the Bootable USB Drive**: Use the `dd` command to copy the ISO file to the USB drive. This will look something like `sudo dd if=/path/to/proxmox.iso of=/dev/diskN bs=1m`, replacing /path/to/proxmox.iso with the actual path to your ISO file and N with your disk number.

6. **Wait**: The `dd` command does not provide any feedback and it may take a while to complete. Just wait until the command prompt returns.

7. **Eject the USB Drive**: Once the `dd` command is completed, you can eject the USB drive by typing `diskutil eject /dev/diskN`.

Please replace `/dev/diskN` with your actual USB drive path and `/path/to/proxmox.iso` with the actual path to the Proxmox ISO file. Be careful with the `dd` command because if you specify the wrong output file (of=...) you can overwrite your system disk.

**Note:** The `dd` command can be dangerous if not used properly, and it's possible to overwrite your system's data. If you prefer a safer and easier option, you can use a GUI tool like balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/). This tool is user-friendly and also has a version for MacOS. The process is straightforward: select the ISO, select the target USB, and then flash it.
